# Logo Setup Instructions

The logo has been integrated into the website. Please follow these steps:

1. **Save the logo image** you provided as `logo.png` in the `public` folder:
   - Location: `d:\Nexora\OnePage\public\logo.png`

2. The logo is already integrated in:
   - **Navbar**: Height of 40px (mobile) to 48px (desktop)
   - **Footer**: Height of 64px

3. The logo will automatically adapt to dark mode since it's on a dark teal background.

## Logo Specifications

- **Format**: PNG (recommended for transparency)
- **Background**: The current logo has a dark teal/navy background
- **Navbar size**: 40-48px height (auto width)
- **Footer size**: 64px height (auto width)

## Alternative: If you want a different logo for dark mode

If you want different logos for light/dark mode, you can:
1. Save two versions: `logo-light.png` and `logo-dark.png`
2. Update the components to conditionally render based on theme

The logo is currently configured to work with the existing dark teal background from your image.
